# pipeline-scripts

This project is to manage pipeline scripts such as Jenkins pipeline and Gitlab CI.

# What I'm going to do

In this repository, I'm going to add the pipeline scripts made by Jenkins pipeline (Declarative pipeline and pipeline scipt) and Gitlab CI. Those two tools are popular tools to set up the CI/CD.

First of all, I will set up the load test conduction jobs implemented by Gatling using Jenkins. And I will expand script examples more and more. 

Please refer to below link on the purpose.
